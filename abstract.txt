
Abstract class:-
An  abstract class is a class which contains abstract method
A abstract method is a method which do not have body, not even curly braces

Any class with one or more abstract method is declared abstract.

An Abstract class can contain concreate methods.The concrete methods are the methods with body.
It is not a must to override concrete methods in the child class



eg:- 

abstract class Abc
{
  abstract  void meth(); // abstract method
     void conc()  //concrete method as it has body
	{
	}
}

An abstract class cannot be instantiated ie object of absctact 
class cannot be created as it is an incomplete class

if a class contains abstract method then that class should
be declared abstract

if a class extends abstract class then there are only 2 options
1) declare the child class as an abstract class
2)  override the inhertied abstract method in the child class


Use:- Absctract class forces the sub-classes to follow a particular pattern



Note:-
An Abstract class can have constructor
Adapter classes are the classes with provide empty implementation of abstract method
of abstract class
