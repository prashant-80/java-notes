

1) simple:- Its eaiser to learn


2) Objected-oriented:- every thing is java is in then form of 
		classes and object.so its provides opps feauturs of 1,2,3,4

3)multithreaded:-multiple parts(task) running at the same time.eg when you play games on the computer ,games and msword

4) Distributed:-An application which run across mutliple host.
                       from local machine as well as net

4)secure:- java does not allows the programmer to manipulate the  meomory 
               of the system or perform pointer arithmetic.Its much more secure than c++
