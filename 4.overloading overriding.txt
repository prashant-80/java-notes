Overloading:-
methods with same name but different signature

calls are made on the basis of match ie args passed

Overriding:- 
writing the method in the child class which
has same name and signature as that of parent


Use: Overloading allows multiple implementation of the same essential  functionality to use the same name.


Difference between

Generally single class in case of Overloading
There are two classes involved in case of Overriding

In overloading methods are added
In Overriding the methods are replaced

return type does not plays important role in case of overloading but 
return type plays important role in case of overriding



Note:-
Overloading can be done in the same class or subclass.
Private methods are not inherited hence not overridden.
Static methods cannot be overridden.
