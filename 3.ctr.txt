ctr:- A ctr is a special method which is used
         to initilize object



difference between method and ctr

method
  They can have any name
  They may or may not have return type if not 
   then void
  They have to be called on an object
  They can perform any type of task

ctr
  They have same name as that of class
  They do not have any return type not even void
  They are called automatically
  They are specifically used to intilize object

Note:-
 ctrs are not inherited
 ctrs are called in the order of inheritance
 ctrs can be overloaded but they cannot be overriden
 not a single object can be created without ctr
 if do not provide the ctr then compile will create a defualt ctr for u 
 a default ctr is a non argument ctr
 eg:-
 
  class Rock
  {
   Rock(  ) //default ctr
  { }
  }

if u create the ctr then compiler will not create
a default ctr for u




super and this
--------------------

super is used to call the desired version of superclass ctr
Call to super() must be first statement in constructor of subclass.



this() is used for inter constructor communication
call to this must be first statement in constructor
